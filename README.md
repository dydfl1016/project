#### Description:

As an English teacher, I have developed a passion for helping learners improve their language skills. I have created this website that serves as an English education platform, providing learners with resources that they can use to enhance their language abilities.

While there are currently no games on the website, I plan to add them in the future to my website or app. This addition will provide learners with a fun and engaging way to practice their English skills, making the learning experience more enjoyable.

My long-term goal is to open my own English academy, which is why this website is necessary. It will serve as a platform to introduce my academy and provide valuable resources for learners who are eager to improve their English proficiency.

The website menu consists of Koogle, home, writings, movies, and teachers. Koogle is a clone-coding practice of Google, where learners can search for what they need. In the future, Koogle will be filled with English game apps, providing learners with a diverse range of fun and engaging games to play.

The home section introduces my academy, and I am proud to share that I will provide a personalized English education that meets the unique needs of each of my students. Through my teaching methods, I hope to make English learning an enjoyable experience for all my students. It is currently filled with something entirely different, but let me talk about my teaching materials that I created on my own for my students. It is about my perspective on coding. It is a poem.

The poem is my perspective on the experience and emotions I have had during my 8 years of taking CS50. I enjoy creating my own books and course materials for my classes, and I continue to do so consistently. I plan to teach my students about poetry in English, and when the time comes, I will teach them about CS50 through poetry. I have already talked about CS50 in my classes, and my students refer to Professor David Malan as 'Malang-i' (meaning dried radish in Korean), as the pronunciation of 'Malan' sounds similar to the Korean word. Anyway, CS50 has given me a lot of inspiration in my work, and I feel that I am constantly improving, which I wanted to express in this poem.

The writings section consists of the teaching materials I have created, which will be filled with books I have written and published. This book was co-written with one of my students. We did a hidden picture game for English vocabulary study, and then we imagined and wrote a story together based on the picture. It was a very informative and enjoyable class. Later, I plan to compile the stories we wrote together with the children and publish a book on Amazon. I get so excited and happy just thinking about these kinds of possibilities. These resources will provide learners with an in-depth understanding of the English language, making it easier for them to master the language.

The movies section will be filled with video teaching materials that I have created. These videos will provide learners with an immersive learning experience, making it easier for them to understand the language and improve their skills. The video is based on the teaching materials that I created. For example, if the students studied reading comprehension about 'Kingsberry' and solved related problems, then they would have to watch a video about 'Kingsberry' as homework on that day. The words and expressions learned that day will be repeatedly practiced through different media. The video teaching materials will also be continuously updated.

Finally, the teachers section introduces the talented teachers who will work alongside me at my academy. They are all passionate about teaching and will provide learners with the support and guidance they need to succeed in their language studies. This is currently filled with my avatar. It is for a section later where I introduce our teachers to parents. Let me tell you a bit about my avatar. Eventually, I want to become a great developer and create an AI that teaches English. I know, by then, someone else may have already created one. But I want to create my own. My AI character or avatar will be able to meet people and have conversations in English in the metaverse or even teach my students. So, I am currently working on creating and developing my avatar, giving it a backstory, and making it unique and look alive for when that time comes. My male students always say my avatar looks terrible.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about "English Game". I hope this elaboration provides you with a better understanding of my project and the value it can offer to learners.

Let me talk about a technical and specialized field now. I read about 'Markdown syntax' and experienced my 91125th moment of frustration. I hesitated to give up for a moment at the 125th try, but then I pulled myself together and tried again. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Since you guys said that HTML and CSS are not programming languages, let me talk about JavaScript. About the orange hamburger icon in the top right corner, my YouTube coding teacher said that it uses JavaScript. When you shrink the window, all the menu items in the center top go into that hamburger icon. Also, there is a place on the main screen where users enter and submit their email addresses, and that part seemed to be made with JavaScript. There were functions in that part. As I write this, I realize that I have a lot more to learn. Anyway, I have come this far. Wish me luck.
